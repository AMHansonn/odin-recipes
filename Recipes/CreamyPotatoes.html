	<div class="ingredients">
		<ul>
			<li>Four thinly sliced Russet or Yukon Gold Potatoes.</li>
			<li>One onion, in rings.</li>
			<li>Salt and Pepper for seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt for the sauce</li>
			<li>3 tablespoons of both Butter and Flour, the cheese sauce.</li>
			<li>2 cups of Milk, for creaminess.</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups of Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div class="instructions">
		<ol>
			<ul>
				<li>Preheat oven to 400 Fahrenheit (approx 205 Celcius)</li>
				<li>Slice your potatoes in 1/4 inch or thinner slices. For best results, use a mandoline if you have one.
				</li>
				<li><b>POTATOES:</b>Layer half of the potatoes in the bottom of the casserole dish, then season with salt
					and pepper to taste. Layer your onion slices on top, then top them with the remaining potatoes. Then
					season it again to taste.</li>
				<li><b>SAUCE:</b>
					<ul>
						<li>Melt your butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Then, gradually whisk in your flour and
							salt and cook that constantly until the raw flour flavor cooks off, which should take approximately
							a minute. Gradually add milk in approximately 1/4 cup increments, whisking well after each
							addition.</li>
						<li>Whisking constantly, cook this until the mixture has thickened, which should take about 30 to 60
							seconds. Stir in all of the cheese at once, continuing to stir until it is all melted, which should
							take about 30 to 60 seconds.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Pour the cheese sauce all over the potatoes and then cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
				<li>Bake in your preheated oven until your potatoes are tender and the sauce is bubbly. This should take
					about an hour and a half.</li>
			</ul>
		</ol>
